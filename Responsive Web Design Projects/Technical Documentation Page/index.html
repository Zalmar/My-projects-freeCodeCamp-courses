                <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C and C++, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and
                    Python.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which
                    means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
                <code>var Früh = "foobar";</code>
                <p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
                <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
                <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than
                    one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has
                    rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more information, see the
                    detailed reference about JavaScript's lexical grammar.) It is considered best practice, however, to
                    always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice
                    reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
                <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a
                    sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or
                    whitespace. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.</p>

            <article>
                <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
                <code>// a one line comment

                    <br>/* this is a longer,
                    <br> * multi-line comment
                    <br> */

                    <br>/* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */</code>

            <article>
                <p>There are three kinds of declarations in JavaScript.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>var</dt>
                    <dd>Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</dd>
                    <dt>let</dt>
                    <dd>Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</dd>
                    <dt>const</dt>
                    <dd>Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers (for more details
                    see this blog post). You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.</p>

                Data structures and types
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                    <ul id="second-list">
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null
                            is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
                        <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful functions with your
                    applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
                    think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application
                    can perform.</p>

        <section id="Literals" class="main-section">
            <header>
                Literals
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>You use literals to represent values in JavaScript. These are fixed values, not variables, that you
                    literally provide in your script. This section describes the following types of literals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Array literals</li>
                    <li>Boolean literals</li>
                    <li>Floating-point literals</li>
                    <li>Integers</li>
                    <li>Object literals</li>
                    <li>RegExp literals</li>
                    <li>String literals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>An array literal is a list of zero or more expressions, each of which represents an array element,
                    enclosed in square brackets ([]). When you create an array using an array literal, it is
                    initialized with the specified values as its elements, and its length is set to the number of
                    arguments specified.</p>
                <p>The following example creates the coffees array with three elements and a length of three:</p>
                <code>var coffees = ['French Roast', 'Colombian', 'Kona'];</code>
                <p>You do not have to specify all elements in an array literal. If you put two commas in a row, the
                    array is created with undefined for the unspecified elements. The following example creates the
                    fish array:</p>
                <code>var fish = ['Lion', , 'Angel'];</code>
                <p>If you include a trailing comma at the end of the list of elements, the comma is ignored. In the
                    following example, the length of the array is three. There is no myList[3]. All other commas in the
                    list indicate a new element.</p>
                <code>var myList = ['home', , 'school', ];</code>
                <p>In the following example, the length of the array is four, and myList[0] and myList[2] are missing.</p>
                <code>var myList = [ ,'home', , 'school'];</code>
